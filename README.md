# Odoo design exercice: Notes
## Accordion
Even if it's visually beautiful to display this section in two columns it is more complex to understand for a user than just stacking the items vertically. Furthermore, I think it's not really aesthetic when you open a panel because you create a visual imbalance between the items.

## Responsive
The page is also responsive with a little "sticky twist" in some sections. I hope you'll like it. 

Thanks for your attention,
Have a nice day,

Brandon
